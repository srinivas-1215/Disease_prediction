🩺 Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting diseases based on user-input symptoms using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to assist in early detection and decision support by leveraging data-driven models.

📌 Project Overview

Disease prediction plays a vital role in healthcare by helping identify potential illnesses at an early stage. This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the most likely disease.

The system takes symptoms as input and provides a predicted disease as output based on trained models.

🚀 Features

Predicts diseases based on given symptoms

Uses Machine Learning algorithms for classification

User-friendly and easy to understand workflow

Can be extended to support more diseases and symptoms

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts
